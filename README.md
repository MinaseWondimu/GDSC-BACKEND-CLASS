i was trying to do through js was creating a calculator that performs both arthimatic opearation and BMI calculation with a function that provides a menu for the user to choose different operations and  continiously running. the challange i faced to do this programme is user's input handl ing as well as handling error to prevent the app from crushing by cases such that divided by zero. i tried to resolve this by using loop to ask the user ubtil the user inputs a valid no and to handle error i make it to  Provide clear error messages to guide the user when they make a mistake.
